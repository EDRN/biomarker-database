    # In retrospect, this explains a lot about how this crap works.
    # The Apache HTTP config's php.conf has:
    #     Alias /bmdb "/usr/local/bmdb/app/webroot"
    # so that requests for /bmdb use files in that directory, â€¦/webroot
    # The config also says:
    #     <Directory "/usr/local/bmdb/app/webroot">
    #         Order allow,deny
    #         Allow from all
    #         AllowOeverride all
    #         DirectoryIndex index.php
    #     </Directory>
    # so that requests hit the index.php file here, and takes the request
    # URI and makes it the "url" parameter passed into index.php
    #
    # Still not exactly sure why we strip the leading "/" off edrn-skin
    # but whatever.
